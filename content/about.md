Hello, my name is Johannes. I created this page as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my [photography](/photography) and [project references](/references).

Creativity is an important part of me, with my photography I would like to capture aesthetics of scenarios surrounding me in a non-arranged way. My favorite genres are photojournalism, documentary and street photography. I am a passionate person, active in outdoor sports like rock climbing and surfing, knowledgeable with and curious about technologies, programming and engineering of open source software.
