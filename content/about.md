Hello, my name is Johannes. I created this page as a personal portfolio and to showcase some of my [photography](/photography) and other projects.

I take inspiration from streets, landscapes, people, the sky, or anything that has beautiful shapes or colors. Working as an Engineering Manager for an international software company I spend my available time as a curious programmer of open source software, enthusiastic photographer and I especially enjoy being outdoors, for example climbing rocks or taking [pictures of other people climbing](/photography/climbing).
