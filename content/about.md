Hello, my name is Johannes. I created this page as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my [photography](/photography) and other projects.

I like to document scenes happening around me, preferably non-arranged photography on streets, in forests, at beaches, at home or while traveling. Apart from being a passionate rock climber, surfer and photographer, I am also a curious programmer of open source software and work professionally as Engineering Manager for an international open source software company.
