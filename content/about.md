Hello, my name is Johannes. I created this page as a personal portfolio and to showcase some of my [photography](/photography) and other projects.

I like to document the scenes happening around me, non-arranged photography on streets, in forests, at home or while traveling. Apart from being an enthusiastic rock climber and photographer, I like to spend time as a curious programmer of open source software and I work professionally as Engineering Manager for an international open source software company.
