Hello, my name is Johannes. I created this page as a personal portfolio and to showcase some of my [photography](/photography) and other projects.

I take inspiration from streets, landscapes, people, the sky, pretty much anything that has beautiful shapes or colors. Working professionally as an Engineering Manager for an international software company I spend my available time as an enthusiastic photographer, curious programmer and I especially enjoy being outdoors climbing rocks as well as taking pictures of people climbing.
